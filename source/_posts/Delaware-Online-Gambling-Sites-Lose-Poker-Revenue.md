#  Delaware Online Gambling Sites Lose Poker Revenue

# Delaware online gambling sites are feeling the pinch of poker revenue losses, with a combined $1.5 million in losses during the past fiscal year.

# Figures released this week by the Delaware Department of Finance show that poker revenue at the state’s three casinos plummeted by more than 25 percent in the last fiscal year.

# The Dover Downs Hotel & Casino led the pack, seeing poker revenue fall from $5.5 million in 2016 to $4.1 million last year – a decrease of 26 percent. Harrington Raceway and Casino followed with a 23 percent drop in poker revenue, while Delaware Park Resort saw a smaller decrease of 10 percent.

# The losses were partially offset by increases in other areas, such as table games and slots. Table games revenue was up 3 percent overall, and slots revenue was up 5 percent.

# Still, with less money coming in from poker, the casinos are looking for ways to shore up their revenues. One possibility is to make it harder for people to gamble away their money on site.

# “At a certain point you have to question whether or not it’s too easy to gamble and whether or not we need to make some changes because of that,” said Governor John Carney earlier this year when asked about the state’s casinos losing money.

#  Nevada Eyes Changes To Make Poker More Appealing

The Nevada state legislature is considering a bill that would make significant changes to the state’s poker laws. The goal is to make the game more appealing to potential players and help the struggling casino industry.

Among the proposed changes are limits on the number of hands that can be played in a given session, changes to blinds and betting structures, and increased penalties for cheating. The bill also calls for the development of new rules for tournament play.

Nevada has been losing out on revenue to neighboring states with more relaxed gambling laws. In order to compete, lawmakers feel that they need to make poker more attractive.

The proposed changes have drawn mixed reactions from casino owners and players alike. Some feel that the new rules will simply make the game less enjoyable, while others argue that they are necessary to keep up with the competition.

No decisions have been made as yet, but it is clear that Nevada is taking poker seriously and is looking for ways to make it more appealing to players.

#  Card Clubs In California Push For Legal Poker

The poker industry in California is facing a possible make or break moment as lawmakers seek to legalize the game. A coalition of more than a dozen card clubs are pushing for the legalization of poker, which would give the industry a much needed boost.

The push for legalization comes at a time when the poker industry is struggling. In recent years, casinos and card clubs have seen a decline in revenue as poker players move online to play Texas Hold’em. If legalized, poker would be offered in regulated environments, similar to what is found in Nevada and New Jersey.

While there is some opposition to legalizing poker, the majority of lawmakers seem to be in favor of it. This was evident earlier this year when a bill seeking to legalize poker was introduced in the state legislature. The bill was authored by Assemblyman Adam Gray, who believes that legalizing poker would bring jobs and economic growth to the state.

Gray’s bill has already picked up a number of co-sponsors, including Assemblymen Mike Gatto and Reggie Jones-Sawyer. It is also backed by a number of card clubs in California, including the Commerce Club, Bay 101 Casino, Hollywood Park Casino, and Bicycle Casino.

If passed, the bill would allow for the licensing of up to 10 card clubs throughout the state. These clubs would be allowed to offer cash games and tournaments, provided they follow certain regulations. Among other things, the clubs would be required to install surveillance cameras and prevent anyone under 21 from playing.

With support from lawmakers and card clubs alike, it seems likely that poker will soon be legalized in California. This would give the state’s gaming industry a much needed boost and could lead to further growth in the future.

#  Atlantic City Casinos Seeing Decline In Poker Revenue

Atlantic City casinos are seeing a decline in poker revenue, according to a report from NJ Online Gambling. The total amount of money taken in by the seven casinos from poker tournaments and cash games was down 17.5 percent in March, compared to the same month last year.

The Borgata took the biggest hit, with its poker revenue down 29 percent year-over-year. Caesars was next, with its revenue down 24 percent, followed by Tropicana (down 20 percent), Golden Nugget (down 18 percent), Harrah's (down 16 percent), and Bally's (down 0.8 percent).

The only casino to see an increase in poker revenue was Resorts, which was up 3.7 percent.

There could be any number of reasons for the decline in poker revenue, but one likely culprit is the overall decline in gambling revenue at Atlantic City casinos. In March, overall gambling revenue was down 6.5 percent year-over-year, with slot machine revenue down 8.5 percent and table game revenue down 2.8 percent.

#  Maryland Considers Online Poker Legislation

The state of Maryland is considering new legislation that would legalize and regulate online poker. The bill, introduced by Delegate Eric Luedtke, would allow the state's five casinos to offer online poker rooms.

According to Luedtke, the bill is designed to help boost the state's casino industry. "The goal is to create new economic activity and jobs in our casino resort areas," he said. "This is a game changer."

The state's gambling industry has been in decline in recent years, with revenue from slots and table games falling by $130 million between 2012 and 2016. Luedtke believes that legalizing online poker could help reverse this trend.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased addiction and social problems. They also point out that there is no evidence that legalizing online poker will lead to increased economic activity or jobs.

However, supporters of the bill argue that regulating online poker will help protect consumers and ensure that the games are fair and honest. It will also allow the state to collect taxes on Poker revenues.

Maryland is not the only state considering online poker legislation. Earlier this year, New York introduced a bill that would legalize and regulate online poker. The bill is currently awaiting a vote in the state senate.
