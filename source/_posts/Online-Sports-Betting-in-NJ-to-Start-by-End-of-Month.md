#  Online Sports Betting in NJ to Start by End of Month

# The long awaited day for legalized sports betting in NJ is almost here.

# Governor Phil Murphy has officially announced that sports betting will be legal in the state starting by the end of the month.

# Legalized sports betting was signed into law back in June, but it has taken some time to get everything organized.

# The Murphy administration is hoping that legalizing sports betting will help to revitalize Atlantic City’s casino industry.

# There are still some details that need to be ironed out, such as which casinos will offer sports betting and what the betting options will be.

# It is still unclear whether or not people will be able to place bets online or only through physical casinos.

# Sports betting is already popular in other states that have legalized it, such as Nevada and Delaware.

# In Nevada, sports betting accounted for $4.8 billion in revenue in 2017.

#  NJ Online Sports Betting Regulations Finalized

The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement finalized the regulations governing online sports betting in the state on Monday. The new regulations will allow Atlantic City casinos and racetracks to offer online betting, subject to approval by the Division of Gaming Enforcement.

“Today’s announcement is a major step forward in our efforts to regulate and authorize sports betting in New Jersey,” said Governor Phil Murphy. “I want to thank Acting Attorney General John Hoffman and Director David Rebuck for their hard work in finalizing these regulations. I also want to thank all of the casino and racetrack owners who have shown their commitment to this process. We are now one step closer to bringing sports betting to New Jersey and creating thousands of jobs in our state.”

Under the new regulations, casinos and racetracks will be able to offer online sports betting through their own websites or through partnerships with licensed third-party providers. Bettors must be physically located within New Jersey borders in order to place a bet.

The Division of Gaming Enforcement will approve each casino and racetrack’s proposed online sports betting operation, including selecting which provider(s) they will partner with. Any casino or racetrack wishing to offer online sports betting must submit an application to the Division of Gaming Enforcement.

Casinos and racetracks will be able to offer a variety of bets, including point spreads, moneylines, over/under totals, parlays, proposition bets, and futures bets. The regulations also allow for betting on individual NFL games once they have started.

The Division of Gaming Enforcement has created an extensive set of rules governing the operation of online sports betting in New Jersey. These rules include requirements that casinos and racetracks maintain detailed records of all transactions, protect against underage gambling and money laundering, and ensure that no one person can bet more than $500 per day.

“With these regulations now in place, we are one step closer to implementing a safe, responsible, and successful sports wagering program in New Jersey that generates revenue for our state while protecting consumers,” said Acting Attorney General John Hoffman.

#  New Jersey Poised to be a National Leader in Online Sports Betting

In May 2018, the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited most states from authorizing sports betting. The decision opened the door for New Jersey and other states to legalize and regulate sports betting.

New Jersey has been moving quickly to capitalize on the ruling. In June, the state legislature passed a bill that allows casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting. The state also plans to allow online sports betting.

Online sports betting could be a major boon for New Jersey's economy. Estimates vary, but it is thought that online sports betting could generate anywhere from $250 million to $1 billion in annual revenue. This would be a major boost to New Jersey's economy, which is still recovering from the recession.

Some opponents of online sports betting argue that it will lead to increased addiction and crime. However, there is no evidence that online sports betting is any more addictive or crime-ridden than traditional sports betting.

New Jersey should embrace online sports betting as a way to spur economic growth and create jobs. It is also a way for the state to attract more tourists; people who visit casinos and racetracks for gambling will now be able to place bets online as well.

#  First Day of Legal NJ Online Sports Betting Sees Millions Wagered

In what is being called a watershed moment for legalized sports betting in the United States, New Jersey’s first day of legal online sports betting saw nearly $3 million wagered. This number is expected to only grow as the novelty of the new law wears off and more people get used to the idea of betting on sports online.

Gamblers placed their bets at regulated online sportsbooks like DraftKings, FanDuel, PointsBet, and 888Sport, as well as at casinos and racetracks around the state. The fact that all four operators reported considerable volume on day one shows that there is plenty of interest in this new form of gambling.

DraftKings saw the most action, with more than $1 million wagered on its site. FanDuel was not far behind with over $900,000 in bets placed. PointsBet handled just under $700,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/)000 worth of wagers, while 888Sport took in about $200,000.

Casinos and racetracks also fared well on day one. Monmouth Park Racetrack took in nearly $500,000 in bets, while Atlantic City’s Borgata casino racked up over $360,000. Caesars AC came in third with just over $300,000 wagered at its properties.

It’s still too early to tell if NJ’s new sports betting market will be a major success or not. However, early indications are very positive and it seems likely that this will be a boon for the state’s economy. With other states soon to follow suit, it looks like legalized sports betting is here to stay!
