#  What will be the format of the show?

The show format will be a competition in which the contestants will have to complete various tasks. The final task will be the most important, as the winner of the show will be the one who completes it first.

The show will be hosted by two presenters. They will explain the tasks and provide commentary on the contestants' progress.

Each episode of the show will last for an hour. The contestants will have a set amount of time to complete each task. If they fail to finish it within the allotted time, they will be eliminated from the competition.

At the end of every episode, the two presenters will announce which contestant has been eliminated from the show. The contestant with the fewest eliminations at the end of the series will be declared the winner.
