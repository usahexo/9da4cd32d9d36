Finding the best slot machine to play at a casino can be daunting, but it’s not impossible. If you know where to look, you can find the best paying machines on the casino floor.

The first thing you want to do is find out where the high limit slots are. These are usually located in a separate room or area away from the main casino floor. This is where you will find machines that pay out better than average.

Another thing to consider is location within the casino itself. The closer you are to the entrance or exit, the higher the chance of getting a winning spin. Pay attention to which machines are closest to each other, too – often times these are linked together and payout more frequently than others.

Finally, always research the payout percentages of each machine before playing. The odds are never in your favour when playing slots, but choosing a machine with a higher payout percentage will give you a better chance of winning something back on your bets.
