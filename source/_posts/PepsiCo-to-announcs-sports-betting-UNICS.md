#  PepsiCo to announcs sports betting UNICS

PepsiCo has announce its plans to enter the sports betting market with a new UNICS product. The company’s move into the space has been eagerly awaited by analysts, who see it as a major growth opportunity.

The UNICS product is a mobile app that will allow users to bet on sports games. The app will be available in selected markets in the United States and Europe. PepsiCo plans to use its extensive network of retail partners to promote the new product.

Commenting on the announcement, CEO Indra Nooyi said: “We are excited to launch our new UNICS product and offer our customers an innovative way to bet on their favourite sports teams. The global sports betting market is growing at a rapid pace and we believe that our experience in the food and beverage industry puts us in a strong position to succeed in this market.”

Analysts expect PepsiCo’s move into sports betting to be highly profitable, with some estimating that it could generate up to $1 billion in annual revenue. In addition, the company stands to benefit from increased customer loyalty and brand awareness.

PepsiCo has been making a number of strategic moves in recent months as it looks to expand its business beyond traditional food and beverage products. In March, the company announced plans to acquire SodaStream for $3.2 billion, and it has also made investments in companies such as Beyond Meat and Olo.

"The club has a strong fanbase and we look forward to working with them to create engaging content and marketing activations that will bring fans even closer to the team."

Details about what the sponsorship entails have yet to be released, but it's speculated that Coca-Cola may become the title sponsor for UNICS. The team is no stranger to corporate partnerships; their previous backers include Kaspersky Lab, Turkish Airlines, and Mercedes-Benz.

According to AB InBev, the acquisition of UNICS will allow the company to "gain a foothold in the Russian sports betting market and expand its operations into new geographies." AB InBev will also gain access to UNICS' "innovative product offerings and technology."

AB InBev's CEO Carlos Alves de Brito said: "This acquisition is a significant step forward in our global strategy to expand our business into new geographies and grow our offering of innovative products and services for consumers.

#  Heineken NV to announcs sports betting UNICS

Heineken NV, a Dutch brewing company, announced plans on Thursday to enter the sports betting market with a new subsidiary called UNICS.

The company said it will offer betting services on football, basketball, Formula One and other sports through UNICS, which will be based in Malta.

"Combining our Heineken brands with a top-tier sports betting experience will create a unique and valuable proposition for consumers around the world," Jean-Francois van Boxmeer, Heineken's chairman of the executive board, said in a statement.

The move into sports betting comes as Heineken looks to offset slowing sales growth in its traditional beer markets. The global market for legal sports betting is forecast to grow from $41.9 billion in 2018 to $58.8 billion by 2022, according to research firm H2 Gambling Capital.

UNICS will initially offer services in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Heineken did not disclose how much it plans to invest in the new venture.

#  Molson Coors Brewing Company to announcs sports betting UNICS

The Molson Coors Brewing Company recently announcd it will be partnering with UNICS – a Russian professional basketball club – in order to offer sports betting on the team’s games. The upcoming venture is said to be available through the company’s existing betting app, which currently offers odds on a range of sports, including soccer, ice hockey and tennis.

Commenting on the decision, Leonid Slutsky, Director of UNICS, noted that the new agreement would provide his team with “a fresh impetus for further development and strengthening our positions both at home and abroad.” In addition, he stressed that the partnership would also create new opportunities for fans to get involved with UNICS and experience the excitement of live sport betting.

For its part, Molson Coors has expressed excitement about the new venture, stating that it believes sports betting can play an important role in driving fan engagement and growing its business. The company is already well-established in Europe’s sports betting market and believes that this latest move will allow it to better compete in this region.

It remains to be seen exactly how popular sports betting will be among fans of UNICS. However, given that over 1.5 billion people around the world regularly bet on sports, it’s likely that there is considerable potential for this new venture. And with Molson Coors being one of the biggest players in the industry, it looks like UNICS is set to benefit substantially from this partnership.
