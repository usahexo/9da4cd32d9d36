#  How to Report Gambling Winnings on Your Tax Return

If you've won money from gambling, you may be wondering how to report those winnings on your tax return. Here's what you need to know.

Gambling Winnings and Losses

Gambling winnings are considered taxable income by the IRS. This includes not just casino games, but also lotteries, horse races, and any other type of wager.

However, losses from gambling can also be deducted from your taxable income. This includes both everyday gambling activities and losses from betting on sports or playing poker. In order to claim a deduction for your losses, however, you must itemize your deductions on your tax return.

Reporting Gambling Winnings and Losses

When you file your tax return, you will need to report both your gambling winnings and losses. You will do this on Schedule A, Itemized Deductions.

On line 21 of Schedule A, you will report your total gambling winnings for the year. This amount will include all of the different types of gambling income that you earned during the year.

Then, on line 28, you will report your total gambling losses for the year. This amount should reflect the total amount of money that you lost while gambling over the course of the year. If you have records documenting your losses, be sure to include them with your tax return.

You can only claim a deduction for gambling losses if they exceed your gambling winnings for the year. So if your gambling winnings were $1,000 and your losses were $500, you would only be able to claim a deduction for $500 worth of losses.

#  When and How to Report Gambling Winnings

The gambling winnings tax is a tax on income generated from gambling. The tax is assessed by the federal government, but it is administered and collected by the individual states. The tax is based on the amount of winnings, not the amount of wagers.

There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to reporting gambling winnings. The best way to determine when and how to report your gambling winnings is to speak with a tax professional. However, there are some general guidelines that can help you get started.

Generally, you will need to report your gambling winnings on your federal income tax return if:

The amount of your winnings exceeds $5,000; AND
The amount of your wagers exceeds the amount of your winnings.

For example, if you won $6,000 from playing blackjack but only bet $1,000, you would still need to report the $6,000 as income. However, if you won $6,000 from playing blackjack and bet $10,000, you would not need to report the winnings because the amount of your wagers exceeded the amount of your winnings.

In most cases, you will also need to report any losses you incurred while gambling. You can claim these losses as a deduction on your taxes. However, you cannot claim more in losses than what you have in wins. So if you won $1,000 and lost $2,000 while gambling in a given year, your only deduction would be $1,000.

If you have questions about when and how to report your gambling winnings or losses, be sure to speak with a qualified tax professional.
