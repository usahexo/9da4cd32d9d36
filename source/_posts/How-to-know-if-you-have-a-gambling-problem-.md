#  How to know if you have a gambling problem 

According to the National Institutes of Health, gambling disorder is a “serious mental illness” that affects around 2 percent of the population. It can lead to many negative consequences, including criminal activity, job loss, and financial instability. So how can you tell if you have a gambling problem? 

There are certain signs and symptoms that may indicate a gambling problem. For example, if you find yourself gambling more often than you intended or losing money that you can’t afford to lose, these could be red flags. You might also experience feelings of guilt or shame about your gambling behaviors. Additionally, if gambling begins to interfere with your work or relationships, it’s likely time to seek help. 

If you think you might have a gambling problem, there are several things you can do. First, talk to someone about it – either a friend or family member or a professional therapist. You can also seek help from organizations like Gamblers Anonymous or National Council on Problem Gambling. Finally, take steps to protect yourself from further harm caused by gambling by setting limits on how much money you gamble and when you gamble. 

If left untreated, gambling disorder can be very damaging both mentally and financially. But with the help of loved ones or professional therapists, it is possible to overcome a gambling addiction and restore balance to your life.
