#  Knicks Blast Celtics in online casino showdown

In an impressive online casino display, the Knicks blasted the Celtics 121-119. Kyrie Irving led the Celtics with 29 points while Kristaps Porzingis led the Knicks with 37.

The Knicks came into the matchup winners of their last two games, while the Celtics had lost three of their last four. The Knicks were playing without Tim Hardaway Jr., who was sidelined with a wrist injury. Courtney Lee started in his place and had a great game, scoring 27 points on 10-of-15 shooting.

The Celtics got off to a hot start and led by as many as nine points in the first quarter. But the Knicks rallied and took a one-point lead into halftime.

The second half was back and forth, with neither team able to pull away. With less than two minutes remaining, Irving hit a three-pointer to give the Celtics a 119-118 lead. But Carmelo Anthony answered with a jumper to give the Knicks back the lead. Irving then missed a jumper, setting up Anthony's game-winning layup.

It was an impressive win for the Knicks, who are now 9-10 on the season. They'll look to build on this win when they face off against the Bucks on Wednesday night.

#  New York Knicks Surge Past Milwaukee Bucks

The New York Knicks were looking to get back on track after their tough loss to the Golden State Warriors and they did just that by cruising past the Milwaukee Bucks 122-112. Five Knicks players scored in double figures, led by Tim Hardaway Jr. with 25 points.

The Bucks got off to a hot start, taking a 36-25 lead in the first quarter, but the Knicks came back to take a 58-56 lead at halftime. The Knicks then pulled away in the third quarter, outscoring the Bucks 34-21 to take control of the game.

Kristaps Porzingis had 20 points, 10 rebounds, and six blocks for the Knicks, while Giannis Antetokounmpo had 29 points, 13 rebounds, and six assists for the Bucks.

The Knicks will look to keep their momentum going when they host the Boston Celtics on Friday night.

#  Carmelo Anthony Leads Knicks to Online Victory

It was a great night for Carmelo Anthony and the Knicks, as they managed to survive against the Nuggets in a 117-110 victory. With Melo leading the way, the Knicks were able to overcome a 15-point deficit and pick up an important road win.

Anthony finished the night with 34 points on 12-of-24 shooting, along with six rebounds and four assists. He was key down the stretch for New York, scoring 11 of his team's 27 points in the fourth quarter.

The Knicks have now won two straight games and six of their last eight, putting them into fifth place in the Eastern Conference. They'll look to keep things going on Saturday when they host the Kings.

#  Tim Hardaway Jr. Lifts Knicks Over Pacers

In his second game back from injury, Tim Hardaway Jr. showed the Knicks what they've been missing.

Against the Pacers on Monday night, Hardaway scored a team-high 33 points on 11-of-21 shooting, including 5-of-10 from three-point range. He also added six rebounds, four assists and two steals in 36 minutes of action.

"He was terrific," Knicks head coach Jeff Hornacek said of his guard. "He got us off to a great start with that first quarter where he hit some shots and then he was attacking downhill."

Hardaway's performance was especially important because Kristaps Porzingis left the game early with an ankle injury. Without their star player, the Knicks needed someone else to step up and Hardaway answered the call.

"That's what Timmy is for," Porzingis said after the game. "When I went down, he had to step up and score points and he did that."

The Knicks will need more performances like this as they battle for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. With Hardaway leading the way, they have a chance to make some noise in the postseason.

#  Kristaps Porzingis, Courtney Lee Power NY Knicks Over Miami Heat

The New York Knicks were facing a must-win game against the Miami Heat on Monday night. In order to keep their playoff hopes alive, they would need to beat the Heat, who had won the first two games of the series.

However, the Knicks received a huge lift from Kristaps Porzingis and Courtney Lee. Porzingis led the way with 31 points and 12 rebounds, while Lee contributed 20 points off the bench.

This was a much-needed victory for the Knicks, who will now have a chance to extend the series in Game 4 on Thursday night.
