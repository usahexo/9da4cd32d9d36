#  George Sand Wins $7 Million At Baccarat Gold Strike Tunica 

On Saturday, George Sand became a multimillionaire by hitting a $7 million jackpot playing baccarat at the Baccarat Gold Strike casino in Tunica, Mississippi.

Sand was sitting at a baccarat table alongside eight other players when she hit the huge jackpot on her very first hand. The 54-year-old from Louisville, Kentucky, said she couldn't believe her eyes when the cards revealed she had won big.

"I just thought it was a dream," Sand said of her moment of triumph. "I hit the jackpot on my first hand - I still can't believe it."

Baccarat is one of the most popular casino games and offers players the chance to win big payouts. In fact, the average baccarat payout at Gold Strike is more than $600,000 - so it's no surprise that Sand was thrilled with her win.

Sand isn't the only lucky punter to have hit the jackpot recently at Gold Strike; in February, an anonymous player scooped $8.5 million playing baccarat. It's clear that this casino is a hot spot for high-rollers looking to win big!

#  George Sand Bests The Casino: Wins Over $1.5 Million At Baccarat Gold Strike 

A woman known only as George, who lives in Reno, Nevada, took home more than $1.5 million this week playing baccarat at the Baccarat Gold Strike casino resort in Jean, Nevada.

George is a frequent player at the Baccarat Gold Strike and her win this week was her largest to date. She started playing at the casino on Sunday and by Wednesday she had amassed her $1.5 million windfall.

Casino officials say that George is a very private person and they don't know much about her except that she is a very experienced gambler who knows how to play the game well.

Baccarat is a card game that is popular with high-rollers and casinos often offer large payouts for winning players. The game is simple to learn but can be difficult to master, which is why it attracts experienced gamblers like George.

George's win this week at the Baccarat Gold Strike is just one of many big wins at casinos around the world recently. Just last month an unnamed British man won nearly $7 million playing blackjack at a casino in Las Vegas.

#  George Sand Hits It Big: Wins Nearly $2 Million Playing Baccarat At Gold Strike Tunica 

George Sand was on a hot streak this past weekend at Gold Strike Tunica, winning nearly $2 million playing baccarat. The 57-year-old from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, started playing on Saturday and didn't stop until she hit the jackpot on Sunday.

"It's a great feeling to win like that," said Sand. "I'm so happy I could jump for joy."

Sand's luck began on Saturday when she won a little over $100,000. She then doubled her money on Sunday, winning nearly $2 million in just a few hours.

"I just kept hitting the right cards," said Sand. "I guess it was my lucky day."

This isn't the first time Sand has had success playing baccarat. Last year she won over $600,000 playing the same game at the same casino.

"George Sand is one of our most consistent players," said casino spokesperson Jackie Lam. "We're always glad to see her at our tables."

Sand says she plans to use her winnings to help her family and friends.

"This will make a big difference in my life and the lives of those around me," she said.

#  Legendary Gambler George Sand Wins Again: Picks Up Over $1.7 Million At Baccarat Gold Strike 

Legendary gambler George Sand is at it again picking up over $1.7 million at the Baccarat Gold Strike casino in Las Vegas. The 73-year old Sand, who goes by a number of aliases, says he's been gambling for over 50 years and has never had a losing streak.

"It's all about the math," said Sand in an interview with a local news outlet. "There's no luck involved, only probabilities and odds."

Sand isn't your average Joe gambler though. He's a professional mathematician who has spent years studying probability theory and game theory. In fact, he's even written a few books on the subject.

"Most people think gambling is all about chance, but that's not true," said Sand. "There's actually quite a bit of mathematics behind it."

And it would appear that Sand knows what he's talking about. Over his 50-year career, he's reportedly won well over $10 million from various casinos across the globe.

So what's his secret? How does he keep winning when everyone else seems to be losing?

According to Sand, it all comes down to making smart bets and knowing when to walk away from the table. He also says that it's important to have a solid understanding of the game you're playing and the risks involved.

"You can't go into any casino expecting to win big without taking some risks," said Sand. "But if you play smart and know what you're doing, you can minimize those risks and come out ahead in the end."

A prominent French female author has just won big at a Mississippi casino. George Sand, pen name for Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin, took home more than $1.5 million from Baccarat Gold Strike Tunica last week.

This is not the first time the writer has enjoyed casino success; Sand won a similar amount at the Golden Nugget in Lake Charles, Louisiana back in February. The 73-year-old Sand said she has no plans to retire and will use her gambling winnings to pay bills and fund further casino trips.

Baccarat is not the only game in which Sand enjoys a winning streak; she is also known to enjoy blackjack, roulette and poker. In fact, her love of gambling began when her father gave her a set of toy dice as a child.

Casino executives are undoubtedly pleased with Sand's latest win; it creates positive publicity and brings in customers who hope to emulate her success.
