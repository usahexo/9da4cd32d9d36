#  Route 66 Casino Set to Reopen in November

The Route 66 Casino is set to reopen in November after being shut down for nearly two years.

However, the casino is now set to reopen under new ownership and with a new name, the Santa Fe Resort and Casino.

The casino is expected to bring in $100 million in revenue each year and will create 1,000 jobs. This is good news for the local community, which has been struggling since the casino closed down.
