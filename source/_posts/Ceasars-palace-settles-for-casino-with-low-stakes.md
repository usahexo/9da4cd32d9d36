#  Ceasars palace settles for casino with low stakes

It wasn't the plan. Developer, Ceasars Palace was looking for a world-class casino resort to grace the strip, and they got one, but with some unexpected compromises.

Las Vegas Sands came in with a high bid and proposal that included a casino floor with stakes high enough to attract the serious player, but also low enough to bring in the masses. In comes Resorts World with a lower bid but also a scaled-down casino floor that met Ceasars original vision.

The deal has been in the works for months and it seems that after all is said and done, Ceasars will be getting a new resort; just not quite what they were hoping for.
