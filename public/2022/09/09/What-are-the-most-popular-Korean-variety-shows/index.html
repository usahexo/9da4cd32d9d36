Here are some of the most popular ones!</p>
<ol>
<li>“Running Man”</li>
</ol>
<p>This is one of the oldest and most popular variety shows in South Korea. It has been airing since 2010 and has had many different cast members over the years. The show is a mix of reality TV and game show, and usually involves a race or challenge between the cast members.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>“I Can See Your Voice”</li>
</ol>
<p>This show is all about guessing peoples’ voices. People who are trying to guess the singer’s identity listen to a clip of their voice without seeing them, and then have to choose from a list of celebrities who they think it could be. Sometimes the clips are of famous people singing covers of lesser-known songs, so it can be quite challenging!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>“The Return of Superman”</li>
</ol>
<p>This show follows the lives of celebrity fathers and their children. It started airing in 2013, and has become one of the most popular variety shows in South Korea. The fathers often take their children on fun adventures or play games with them, which makes for entertaining television!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>“Produce 101”</li>
</ol>
<p>This show is all about finding new singing stars. 101 contestants compete against each other until only one remains. The competition is fierce, but there have been some extremely successful singers who have come from this show!</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-most-popular-Korean-variety-show-hosts"><a href="#Who-are-the-most-popular-Korean-variety-show-hosts" class="headerlink" title="Who are the most popular Korean variety show hosts?"></a>Who are the most popular Korean variety show hosts?</h1><p>There are many popular Korean variety show hosts, but some of the most well-known and loved hosts include Shin Dong-yup, Kim Heechul, Yoo Jae-suk, and Park Myung-soo.</p>
<p>Shin Dong-yup is a veteran host who has been around since the early days of Korean variety shows. He is known for his quick wit and humor, as well as his down-to-earth attitude. He currently hosts the show “Knowing Brothers” alongside Lee Soo-geun, Jang Do-yeon, and Kim Yong-man.</p>
<p>Kim Heechul is a member of the K-pop group Super Junior and gained popularity for his quick wit and sharp sarcasm on variety shows. He has hosted many shows over the years, including “Radio Star,” “Golden Fishery,” “A Hyung I Know,” and “My Little Television.”</p>
<p>Yoo Jae-suk is arguably one of the most popular Korean variety show hosts of all time. He started out hosting shows like “Stupid Idol” and “X-Man,” but rose to mainstream popularity when he started hosting “Running Man.” He has since hosted many other shows such as “Infinite Challenge” and “Happy Together.”</p>
<p>Park Myung-soo is another long-time variety show host who first made a name for himself on the show “Nonstop.” He is known for his dry sense of humor and bluntness. He currently hosts the show “Park Myung Soo’s Radio Show” on JTBC every Saturday night.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-format-of-a-typical-Korean-variety-show"><a href="#What-is-the-format-of-a-typical-Korean-variety-show" class="headerlink" title="What is the format of a typical Korean variety show?"></a>What is the format of a typical Korean variety show?</h1><p>Korean variety shows are unique in that they often incorporate a wide range of elements, including games, music, and comedy skits. While the exact format may vary from show to show, most follow a similar pattern.</p>
<p>The show typically begins with an opening act, typically consisting of a popular singer or group performing one or more songs. This is followed by an introduction of the cast and crew, after which the main segment of the show begins.</p>
<p>Most variety shows feature several segments, each lasting around 10-15 minutes. These segments can be anything from game shows to comedy skits to interviews. At the end of the show there is usually a closing performance by the guests or cast members.</p>
<p>Korean variety shows are immensely popular and attract large audiences. They are a great way to experience Korean culture and enjoy some laughs along the way.</p>
<h1 id="What-kind-of-humor-do-Korean-variety-shows-typically-incorporate"><a href="#What-kind-of-humor-do-Korean-variety-shows-typically-incorporate" class="headerlink" title="What kind of humor do Korean variety shows typically incorporate?"></a>What kind of humor do Korean variety shows typically incorporate?</h1><p>Korean variety shows are known for their humor. They typically incorporate slapstick, physical comedy, and irony. For example, in one episode of 내가 할 수 없는 10시 30분 (I Can’t Do That at 10:30), the cast attempted to make a pizza. However, they were unsuccessful and the end result was a disaster. The humor in this scene came from the fact that the cast was trying to do something they were clearly not skilled at.</p>
<p>Another example of Korean variety show humor is the use of puns. In one episode of 하루 1회 (One Day), the cast had to guess what objects their co-hosts were describing based on only a single picture. One co-host described a can of 과일잼 (fruit jam) as being “like death.” The punchline was that the word for “death” in Korean is “인사” (insa), which is also the word for “hello.”</p>
<p>Physical comedy is also common in Korean variety shows. In one episode of 백년의 비밀 (The 100-Year Secret), Lee Seo Jin had to dress up like a woman and act as Ma Dong Seok’s wife. Ma Dong Seok pretended to be angry with his “wife” and started hitting her with a pillow. This resulted in Lee Seo Jin getting hit in the face with the pillow.</p>
<p>Slapstick is also commonly used in Korean variety shows. In one episode of 1 vs 100, Kim Jong Kook was chosen as one of the contestants. He was teamed up with HaHa and they had to try to answer questions correctly. If they got a question wrong, they would have to take a punishment from HaHa. One punishment involved HaHa hitting Kim Jong Kook in the face with a fish tank full of water.</p>
<h1 id="Are-there-any-unique-aspects-of-Korean-variety-shows-that-make-them-different-from-those-in-other-countries"><a href="#Are-there-any-unique-aspects-of-Korean-variety-shows-that-make-them-different-from-those-in-other-countries" class="headerlink" title="Are there any unique aspects of Korean variety shows that make them different from those in other countries?"></a>Are there any unique aspects of Korean variety shows that make them different from those in other countries?</h1><p>Korean variety shows, or 패밀리콘서트 (pamilri konsuetteu), are massively popular both in South Korea and abroad. However, there are some unique aspects to these shows that make them quite different from those in other countries.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most defining features of Korean variety shows is the high level of interaction between the guests and hosts. This often leads to a lot of banter and comedic moments. Additionally, Korean variety shows often have a more panel-based format, with each guest taking turns in talking on various topics.</p>
<p>Another distinguishing feature of Korean variety shows is the use of music as a central component. In many cases, the show will have a band or singer feature as a regular guest, and they will often contribute to the overall atmosphere and humor of the show.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the most popular elements of Korean variety shows are the challenges or games that are played between the guests. These challenges often vary in complexity and can be incredibly funny to watch.</p>
