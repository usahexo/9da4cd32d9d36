        <h1 id="If-the-Chukchansi-casino-reopens-what-will-be-the-long-term-impact-on-the-Oakland-Athletics"><a href="#If-the-Chukchansi-casino-reopens-what-will-be-the-long-term-impact-on-the-Oakland-Athletics" class="headerlink" title="If the Chukchansi casino reopens, what will be the long-term impact on the Oakland Athletics?"></a>If the Chukchansi casino reopens, what will be the long-term impact on the Oakland Athletics?</h1><p>The Oakland Athletics (A’s) have been without a home ever since the Chukchansi casino shut down in October 2015. This left the team with little choice but to play their home games at the O.co Coliseum, which they share with the Oakland Raiders of the NFL. The A’s have made it clear that they would like to move out of the O.co Coliseum and build a new stadium, but haven’t been able to come up with a proposal that is acceptable to both the city of Oakland and Alameda County.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what will happen if and when the Chukchansi casino reopens. On one hand, it could be seen as a positive sign for the city of Oakland and the A’s, as it would mean that the casino is generating enough revenue to stay open. On the other hand, it could be seen as a negative sign for the A’s, as it would mean that there is no longer a need for them to have a stadium in Oakland.</p>
<p>If the Chukchansi casino does reopen, it will likely have a negative long-term impact on the A’s. There are several reasons for this. First, the casino is likely to siphon away some of the revenue that would have otherwise gone to the team. This could cause attendance at A’s games to drop, as fans may choose to spend their money at the casino instead. Second, having a casino near their stadium could lead to an increase in crime and violence around the stadium. This could make it difficult for fans to safely attend games or leave after games. Finally, having a casino near their stadium could cause some sponsors to withdraw their support from the team. This could further reduce revenue and make it more difficult for the A’s to build a new stadium.</p>
<h1 id="If-the-Chukchansi-casino-reopens-what-will-be-the-short-term-impact-on-the-Oakland-Athletics"><a href="#If-the-Chukchansi-casino-reopens-what-will-be-the-short-term-impact-on-the-Oakland-Athletics" class="headerlink" title="If the Chukchansi casino reopens, what will be the short-term impact on the Oakland Athletics?"></a>If the Chukchansi casino reopens, what will be the short-term impact on the Oakland Athletics?</h1><p>The reopening of the Chukchansi casino could have a major impact on the Oakland Athletics. The casino has been closed since October 2014, when a dispute between the tribe that owns it and another faction erupted into violence. If the casino reopens, it could provide much-needed revenue for the tribe, which would in turn allow the Athletics to sign better players.</p>
<p>The Athletics have been one of the worst teams in baseball in recent years, and their low salary budget has been a major factor. In 2015, the team’s opening day payroll was just $59 million, which was 27th out of 30 teams. By comparison, the Los Angeles Dodgers had the highest payroll in baseball at $236 million.</p>
<p>If the casino reopens, it could provide a significant financial boost to the tribe. In 2014, before the casino closed, it generated $167 million in revenue. The tribe has said that it will reinvest some of this money back into the casino, but it is also likely to use some of it to improve its finances. This could allow the Athletics to sign better players and improve their performance.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that the casino will reopen anytime soon, but if it does, it could provide a major boost to the Oakland Athletics.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-chances-that-the-Chukchansi-casino-will-reopen"><a href="#What-are-the-chances-that-the-Chukchansi-casino-will-reopen" class="headerlink" title="What are the chances that the Chukchansi casino will reopen?"></a>What are the chances that the Chukchansi casino will reopen?</h1><p>The Chukchansi casino, which was closed in October of 2014, is currently in the process of being reopened. The casino is set to reopen in March of 2016, and there are many people who are curious about what the chances are that it will actually happen.</p>
<p>There are a few things that need to happen in order for the casino to reopen. First, the tribal council needs to approve the reopening. Second, the National Indian Gaming Commission needs to approve the reopening. And third, the state of California needs to approve the reopening. All three of these things appear to be happening, and so it seems likely that the Chukchansi casino will reopen in March.</p>
<p>There are a few concerns that still remain, however. One concern is that the tribe is divided on whether or not the casino should reopen. There are some members of the tribe who feel that the casino has caused too many problems and that it should not reopen. There are also concerns about how much money the tribe will make from the casino. Some members feel that not enough money will be returned to the tribe, and this could cause tension among members of the tribe.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, it seems likely that the Chukchansi casino will reopen in March. This will be good news for local residents and for businesses in the area who have been struggling since the casino closed down.</p>
<h1 id="If-the-Chukchansi-casino-does-not-reopen-what-will-be-the-long-term-impact-on-the-Oakland-Athletics"><a href="#If-the-Chukchansi-casino-does-not-reopen-what-will-be-the-long-term-impact-on-the-Oakland-Athletics" class="headerlink" title="If the Chukchansi casino does not reopen, what will be the long-term impact on the Oakland Athletics?"></a>If the Chukchansi casino does not reopen, what will be the long-term impact on the Oakland Athletics?</h1><p>The Chukchansi Gold Resort and Casino, located in Coarsegold, California, has been closed since October 2015 due to a power struggle between the tribe’s two factions. The closure has had a significant impact on the Oakland Athletics (A’s), as the casino is their biggest source of revenue.</p>
<p>If the casino does not reopen, it will have a long-term impact on the A’s. They may be forced to move from their current home in Oakland or face bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The A’s currently play in the O.co Coliseum, which they share with the Oakland Raiders of the NFL. The stadium is owned by the city of Oakland and Alameda County. The A’s lease expires at the end of this year, and they are negotiating a new lease with the city and county.</p>
<p>If the casino does not reopen, it is likely that the A’s will not be able to reach an agreement on a new lease. The city and county would prefer to have the Raiders leave O.co Coliseum and make way for the A’s, but they are not willing to pay for a new stadium. Without the casino as a revenue stream, the A’s may be forced to move to another city or declare bankruptcy.</p>
<h1 id="If-the-Chukchansi-casino-does-not-reopen-what-will-be-the-short-term-impact-on-the-Oakland-Athletics"><a href="#If-the-Chukchansi-casino-does-not-reopen-what-will-be-the-short-term-impact-on-the-Oakland-Athletics" class="headerlink" title="If the Chukchansi casino does not reopen, what will be the short-term impact on the Oakland Athletics?"></a>If the Chukchansi casino does not reopen, what will be the short-term impact on the Oakland Athletics?</h1><p>The Chukchansi casino has been a huge financial boon for the Oakland Athletics, contributing an estimated $30 million to the team’s coffers over the past decade. With the casino closed, the A’s could lose as much as $10 million this season.</p>
<p>The team was already struggling financially before the casino closed, and may have to lay off employees or reduce player salaries in order to make up for the lost revenue. The A’s may also have to abandon their plans to build a new stadium in Oakland, which would be a major setback for the team and its fans.</p>
