While hunting for murderers that have slipped through the cracks of the justice system, Dexter kills them in their own way, using his “dark Passenger” to guide him. The show has been nominated for dozens of awards and has won several, including the 2006 Peabody Award.</p>
<p>The first season of Dexter introduces the audience to Dexter’s world and begins to explore the dynamics of his relationships with Rita (his girlfriend), Harry (the adoptive father who taught him how to kill), Lila (a disturbed woman who becomes his therapist), and Sergeant James Doakes (a homicide detective who gradually suspects Dexter’s true nature). At the end of season one, Dexter kills Lila after she learns about his other life.</p>
<p>In seasons two and three, Dexter deals with the aftermath of killing Lila and tries to maintain his relationships with Rita and Harrison (their son). Meanwhile, he continues to hunt for murderers and becomes involved with Brian Moser (the Ice Truck Killer) and Lumen Pierce (a woman whose fiancé was killed by Boyd Fowler, one of Dexter’s victims). Season three ends with Dexter having to kill Brian in order to protect Harrison.</p>
<p> Seasons four and five focus on Dexter’s attempt to hide his involvement in Brian’s death from Sgt. Doakes as well as his ongoing struggle with what it means to be a serial killer. In season four, he meets a woman named Hannah McKay and begins a relationship with her, but ends up killing her when he discovers she is actually obsessed with him and wants him to turn himself in. In season five, he finally confronts Sgt. Doakes and kills him; however, this leads to an increased police presence in Miami which makes it difficult for him to continue his killings.</p>
<p>Season six follows Dexter as he goes on the run from the police after they discover Hannah’s body at his house. He eventually turns himself in and goes on trial for her murder, but is found not guilty thanks to an impassioned speech from his lawyer sister Debra. After being released from custody, Dex returns home only to find that Sgt. Doakes’ brother has taken over Miami Metro Homicide and is now determined to capture him.</p>
<p>The final season of Dexter sees Dex dealing with both this new threat as well as the return of Hannah, who has escaped custody and is now desperate for revenge against him. In the end, Dex kills both Hannah andTGDoakes’ brother, thus finally achieving freedom from their obsession with him.</p>

<h1 id="6-5-black-jack-what-is-jt-Is-An-Absolute-Must-See"><a href="#6-5-black-jack-what-is-jt-Is-An-Absolute-Must-See" class="headerlink" title="6  5 black jack what is jt Is An Absolute Must-See!"></a>6  5 black jack what is jt Is An Absolute Must-See!</h1><p>There are several different table games you can find in a casino, but blackjack is one that always seems to draw a crowd. It’s an exciting game, and one you can actually have a decent chance of winning if you know what you’re doing. In this article, we’ll teach you the basics of how to play blackjack so that you can hit the casino tables with confidence!</p>
<p>The Basics of Blackjack</p>
<p>Blackjack is a card game that involves trying to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The game is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and the player and dealer are each dealt two cards at the start of the game. The goal is to beat the dealer by either getting closer to 21 than they are, or by collecting a higher total value with your first two cards than the dealer has.</p>
<p>If your first two cards add up to 21 (such as an Ace and a Ten), you win automatically - this is called a “blackjack”. You can also win if your first two cards are an Ace and a King, or if your first card is an Ace and your second card is any ten-valued card. If you don’t get blackjack, the aim is then to collect a higher total value than the dealer without going over 21.</p>
<p>To play, you can either hit (draw another card) or stand (stick with what you’ve got). If you go over 21, you bust and lose automatically. The trick is trying to make the best decision based on what’s in front of you - for example, whether it’s worth risking another card if there’s a good chance of going bust, or whether it’s better to stick with what you’ve got.</p>
<p>House Edge</p>
<p>The house edge in blackjack comes from the fact that the player isn’t actually playing against other players - they’re playing against the house itself (the dealer). This means that the casino has an advantage over players, because it’s always odds-on that it will win in the long run. This advantage varies depending on how many decks are being used in the game - typically, games with more decks have a higher house edge. For this reason, it’s important to try and find casinos that use fewer decks when playing blackjack.</p>
